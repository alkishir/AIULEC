Title: Summar vacation I have a great time here in Britain. Britain is big and beautiful country. Tourist guide has shown me everything. where we toured the places of tourist importance, such as Beige Ben and Bakham. I’ve visited many museums and theaters there. I visited most of the cities and the cost of living was relatively low in most of the United Kingdom cities exept London, which is the most expensive cities in the world. London is the world’s first city that has been established.
