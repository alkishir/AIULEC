It is often argued that a happier life is a result of studying philosophy . I complete disagree with this opinion , I think it is not the right way achieve happiness in life . 
Firstly , studying philosophy is not the correct choice to have , a happy peaceful life . it cause mental health problems , it may led to break downs , also makes the person always worried and nervous from everything happens . Secondly , when a person starts to read a lot in the philosophy world , he wo n't be able to stop reading . Moreover , it makes the person so far from everyone , in his own word of philosophy . To conclude , in my opinion philosophy is not the right choice to have a peaceful and happier life .
