Intensive studying is crucial now days . Some students learn their subjects alone in detailed way , so , they qualify their learning . The benefits of such strategy is to develop their learning in appropriate way . Thier goal is to understand the subjects and clarify some ambiguous concepts . However , they need all the time to their own subjects so 
they can learn in smooth way . This point of view can enhance deep learning about the subject . The advantage of this to study in specific and general way . In addition , in the first view they want to study another extra subjects . It is valuable because they know general information about other subjects . It is effective because they will not get bored while learning . So , they are learning extensively about all the subjects The advantage of this view to learn the material in general way . I like the second view because you can enhance your own additional subject .
