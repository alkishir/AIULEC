I agree with you , because they can understand the life , and they have ability to breeding the children and learn them . By the way , I agree with this idea from age 19 for both the boys and girls . On the other hand some people can marry their children in the age 15 or 16 I do n't agree with this idea , it 's a bad idea , because they do n't know anything about the life , about cleaning the house , speaking with the older people or cooking the food ... etc ... In my opinion the best age for marriage in the age 24 . They 
are finished the study in stage the university . In my country , the people can be marry in any age after the age 13 and above . we must that put the law for this idea .
