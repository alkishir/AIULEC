Title: My best memory An intresting was when I went to sea with my uncles' families. We decided to gonna sea together before a day. The next day we went in two cars, it was a good jorney. After that, we arrived at " Manazel Al-Ezz summar resort". Then we paid a hundred dinars. In fact, it's not too expensive compared too other resorts. After that, we entered, and it was very beautiful, it contains a cafe, restaurant, woter games, a mosque and chalets too. Finally, it was a nice day and I liked everything there, and I'd be happy if we did it again.
