I agree with that , because the family will have a different day , make a change in their routine , have a time together maybe they ca n't have in their home , talk to each other . It 's a good idea to make the relation between them more beautiful and stronger , not just to eat in restaurant build family ties ; anything make a differ in the family lifestyle can build family ties
