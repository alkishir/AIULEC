Title: Some people feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21 In my opinion the legal age at which people can marry is different to men and women. I see that the best age for men to marriage is between “25-3” because I think the men be more awareness in this age, and the best age for women to marriage can be between 2-3 because I think that the women be more strengthen to face life problems and more awareness to be mother.
