My best memory happened in my whole life when I was live in tunisia , it was when was I at 10 , I traveled with my dad to another city by the car its names Hammamat , its a beautiful 
city and it has a nice sea . This city always crowded because it 's tourist city so you will meet a lot of people from different country , I spend the whole day with my dad , I bought to me an ice cream , chocolate , some cold drinks . Also we got a delicious lunch in nice restaurant ... At the end of the day we back home and I was very happy because I spent my day with the person I 'll love him for my whole life ..
