My summer break was very normal but I enjoyed it . I went to Tripoli with my friends , It was a time full of relaxation and loads of fun . We stayed at a tremendous and amazing resort that had a pool right near our room . The food was very delicious , we visited the beach and participated in all water sports and activities . My favorite activity was 
the surfing ride ! On the last day , we visited an ancient island near the shore . It was an incredible time .
