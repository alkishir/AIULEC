Title: good teacher Who is the good teacher? I think teaching is not just a job that people gain salary money from. It is a matter of morality , a value message and a entire life at school or university separated from home. students may love or hate going to school often depending on how teachers are good . Good teacher is inspire, kind, perfect, flexible and many merits other. In contrats, a bad teacher can destroy every positivity, each minimum of desire to keep going .But it is crucial to say that there is a third type of teachers which is in between good and bad who doesn’t let neither positive nor negative side in student’s memories. Finally, I am really grateful and thankful for teacher who inspired me more confident in myself... Here ,at university or at school ... You are the best..
