Title: My best memory My best memory was when I in the school and met my best friend "Fatima". I was " the "new student" in the school. And I do not know anyone, everything was strange and I was very shy. In the first week, I stay alone and I probobly didn't talk to anyone, then I met her and she was an angel to me, we was talking a lot about our selves , families hoppies,dream, and every thing, from that time to up we were the best friends. we have been a friend for 9 years ago.
