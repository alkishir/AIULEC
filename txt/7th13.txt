I agree with this opinion . because male and female in the age after 21 can to marry and open new life , of course they are adult to face any difficult circumstance of life because their have balanced behavior with each other . They can raise children properly and bear responsibly for them and build a new generation . This age is suitable to marry because it has less divorce rate between couples than the age before 21 . They act wisely with each other in front of their children and build generation without psychological problem . Marry life is give respect between couples and their children . Marry life to continue should be the couples respect and love each other .
