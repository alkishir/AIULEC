Actually I choosed this title because I have lots of strange experience . First when I was child I leaved out of My country more than 8 years , when I come back to Libya I was really surprised about the life here , The life is not like How I used to live , and it makes me nervous . Second , before I start collage I was wandering about the major that I have to choose but suddenly I found myself in English department , that was strange for me , but it 's useful in the same time . I always tells 
myself this experience and others makes myself more confident , and I do nt have anything to worry about it .
