Title: self-discipline has its advantages and disadvantages on how the individual persives it. It can lead to reaching major goals when we adaptate to the right plan we make for ourselves. for instance, having your plan written and getting yourself occupied and consistant into doing what leads to the good whether its a main priorty or not or even a minor goal can lead you to being a successful person at anything you master. That mostly depends on your level of dedication and self-essteem on how much you have convineced yourself that “you can do it!”. On the other hand, it can lead to major inner psychological problems when the individual takes it too far , for example : being overly obsessed by wanting something that harms you rather than benifits you, being overly obsessed by positions and not being satisfied enough whith where you are at , or even developing jealousy towards a rivals level at something or hating your owen self for not reaching the goal. The healthiest way into being self disciplined is ditching the “obsesseive” mindset and swiching to personal growth, learning to accept yourself and not having co-comparison towards others . But rather comparing yourself with the “yesterday” you. The key to successful discipline is both consistancy and a healthy balance at anything that dosen’t lead you to inner psychological problems. learn to balance not strict behaviour that will eventanally turn on you negatively.
