Title: Some people feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21. To what extent do you agree or disagree? I agree. I agree, but it depend on the person him or her self. This age it is suitable for some people because they feel their ability to success in their life and work in young age but other feel they will be fail because they cann't between the life and work in the beginning of their work. In my opinion the age 21 is suitable but this need arrange the time. The marry in 21 age has many advantage one of them you make children and this the beautiful things and make the life very great because children the prettier thing in the life. The second one the stability in life this the important thing and anyone in this life seek to get the stability because all need that. in conclusion, the marry in 21 is suitable but dependent on the person as I siad before and the the life for anyone diferent for other so this subject diferent and more wild. in conclusion, The marry in 21 is suitable but dependent on the person as I siad before and thelife for anyone diferent for other so this subject diferent and more wild.
