Diaries are important in keeping memories, whether good or bad. Keeping good memories is important for moments of sadness. You can always go back in time and read your exact feelings about these moments. This will make you realize how happy your life is, and how life has its ups and downs. It also makes you realize that your life isn’t as bad as you think in moments of grief. When it comes to bad moments, it's also important to keep them and write them down. Reading through your bad times shows you what you’ve accomplished. These memories good or bad, give you strength and a better understanding of the person you’ve become.
