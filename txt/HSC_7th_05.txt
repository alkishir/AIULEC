Title: Some university students want to learn about other subjects. Others belive it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification. Discuss this view and give your own opinion The students when want to learn only study subject. It means the student can’t focus on more than these subject and their content of course they can study subject more than their main subject but their mind don’t belive this idea. on the other hand there are students belive to study more than their main subject and they can focus all of them study addition subject it is good idea to almost students to improve their level studying or improve themselves in my opinion student focuse on their subject only in briud of the study and they can study addition subject in holidays or in freetime
