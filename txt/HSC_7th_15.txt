Title: ................. I agree with you, because they can understand the life, and they have ability to breeding the children and learn them. By the way, I agree with this idea from age 19 for both the boys and girls. On the other hand some people can marry thier children in the age 15 or 16 I don’t agree with this idea, it’s a bad idea, because they don’t know anything about the life, about cleaning the house, speaking with the older people or cooking the food...etc... In my opinun the best age for marige in the age 24. They are finished the study in stage the university. In my country, the people can be marry in any age after the age 13 and above. We must that put the law for this idea.
