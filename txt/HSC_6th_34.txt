Title: strict self-discipline Is the strict self-discipline the best road to happiness? . In my opoinion (No) , I don’t agree with this thing at all, some people think when they do it in the hard way they will get better life. Of course on, you have to care about yourself because if you care about you will get the better life that everyone want it,. I think when you put yourself in stressed and hard time , focusing on this and this and do this and don’t do this this that’s will make you give up in your life and never be successful in anything; my advice to just live yourself in normal way, know the genral rules and neve think it about so much of course self-discipline is important thing but not strict way . it's how to make humans live good, normal and better life together and make you know what ; your and what you have to do in the life and with the people you live with them. make it easy on yourself and you will find yourself comfortable and doing good things. The best road to happiness is to care about yourself and know what’s yours and what you have to do to others.
