Studying at university includes different types for studying . Some students like to learn generally , they learn about their main subjects . In addition , they learn about other subjects . Those students are opened to study and learn different extent of learning process , to get new and different experiences as well as to improve their own knowledge , and give their minds the flexibility of thinking and working on more than only the subject they study now . This type of students are hard-working and want to experience new fields . There are other type of students , the students who studying for a qualification . They focus only on the degrees and marks . So , they give all their time and attention to study this . They want only to pass and be successful students , after finish their studying they can learn and get more knowledge . In my opinion , I think the first type of students is better , because it 's nice to get a new experience in different fields of knowledge .
