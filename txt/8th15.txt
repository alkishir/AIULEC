Family is the peaceful tree that each leave of it can live and to be save within . My family are the members , my dad , mum , my brothers and sisters , who always motivate me and we share our resented situations together . My mother is my warm place , my father is my hero , my brothers are my bodyguards , and about sisters , are friends .
