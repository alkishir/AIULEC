Title: Some people feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21. To what extent do you agree or disagree? I agree this question. The legal marriage age depate and is complex and require careful discussion. There are some people agree and the others do not. Some people agree because they believe the life is about marriage and this age is the best to complete their life with the right person. However the other people believe they should have the freedom to marry at any age.
