I have started in English when I was fifteen by watching TV a lot , Especially the cartoon movies those shown on TV channels , In addition There is an environment surround me like my father is an architect works with foreigners when he calls to them on the phone I listen to him carefully but the main reason make me good in English is English-speaking animation , Moreover practicing with anyone speaks English , For instance My uncle 's wife she is British . So the main cause and influence is practicing in everyday life , I 
think its very effective to develop the language . To improve the language quickly and effectively listening is the most important skill in acquiring language the comes after directly speaking without any hesitation . I will add more .
