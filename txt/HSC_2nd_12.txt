Title: My timetable for a day I wake up early. First, I prepar myself and eat my breakfast. Then I go to the college. Third, I meet my friends and take my chapters to the lessions. After that, I back to the home and drink some coffee with my mother – this's the best time for me – finally, I work what I have to do and go to sleep.
