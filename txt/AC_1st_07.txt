Title: My Home ~The best place I think ill talk about the best place in the world ~ Home. Home is that nice, rest and comfortable place, that you can stay in as you want. There you can find erea that you love for no reason, and your comfortable bed. Hearing the loud voice of the TV, and screaming of those noisy children... that’s nice to describe, but it’s not like that, in fact.
