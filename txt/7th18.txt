I disagree because there is No age for marriage because it 's different from one to one If I took about this generation they are very lazy There 's a lot of people older than 21 act like children and they have n't any experience in life a lot of man in this age have n't work and still in home like girls playing play station and sleeping most of time 
no benefit of them just eating and sleep depend on his father opposites some people independent on them self from young age I talk about those people who works any studying at 
the same time The principled people and can take important decision and take care of children and gives him what they need in conclusion there 's on age for marriage in the simple way the person who find in himself ability and saw in himself ready to do this step I made of ready ready from whole way 's psychology health . society and not age determent when we should to marriage .
