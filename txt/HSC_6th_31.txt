Title: ........................ Writing a diary is the bad way to review how happy you are , because when you write your diary with the details , you will be forced to remmber all you bad moments that it passed , So get more saffering , but I agree with write your only happy moments and ignore the bad , sometimes you need to remmber a great and fun events , some people write thier diary to identified and develop themself.
