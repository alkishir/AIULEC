Title: Philosophy It is often argued that a happier life is a result of studying philosophy. I complety disagree with this opinion, I think it is not the right way acheive happiness in life. Firstly, studying philosophy is not the correct choice to have , a happy peacful life. it cause mental health ploblems ,it may led to break downs, also makes the person always worried and nervouse from everything happens . Secondly, when a person starts to read a lot in the philosophy world , he wont be able to stop reading . Moreover, it makes the person so far form everyone , in his own word of philosophy. To conclude, in my opinion philosophy is not the right choice to have a peaceful and happier life.
