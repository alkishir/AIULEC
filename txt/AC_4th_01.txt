Title: A Day with My dog Last week I had an outing day with my dog. We enjoyed doing alot of activities. One of them was to built a house for my dog. So, we gathered the wood and then combined it form the house shape. My dog had helped me alot on house was amazing as well as the form we had. I love my dog so much and I wish we have alot of activities together.
