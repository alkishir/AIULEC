I have a great time here in Britain . Britain is big and beautiful country . Tourist guide has shown me everything . where we toured the places of tourist importance , such as 
Big Ben and Buckingham . I 've visited many museums and theaters there . I visited most of the cities and the cost of living was relatively low in most of the United Kingdom cities except London , which is the most expensive cities in the world . London is the world 's first city that has been established .
