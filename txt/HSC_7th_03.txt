Title: Some university students want to learn about other subjects. Others belive it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification. Discuss this view and give your own opinion Studying at university includes different types for studying. Some students like to learn generally, they learn about their main subjects. In addition, they learn about other subjects. Those students are opened to study and learn different extent of learning process, to get new and different experiences as well as to improve their own knowledge, and give their minds the flexibility of thinking and working on more than only the subject they study now. This type of students are hard working and want to experience new fields. There are other type of students, the students who study for a qualification. They focus only on the degrees and marks. So, they give all their time and attention to study this. They want only to pass and be successful students, after finish their studying they can learn and get more knowledge. In my opinion, I think the first type of students is better, because it’s nice to get a new experience in different fields of knowledge.
