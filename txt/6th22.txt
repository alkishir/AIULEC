It can lead to reaching major goals when we adipate to the right plan we make for ourselves . for instance , having your plan written and getting yourself occupied and consistent into doing what leads to the good whether it 's a main priority or not or even a minor goal can lead you to being a successful person at anything you master . That mostly depends on your level of dedication and self-esteem on how much you have convinced yourself that you can do it ! . On the other hand , it can lead to major inner psychological problems when the individual takes it too far , for example : being obsessed by wanting something that harms you rather than benefits you , being overly obsessed by positions and not being satisfied enough with where you are at , or even developing jealousy towards a rival 's level at something or hating your own self for not reaching the goal . The healthiest way into being self-disciplined is ditching the obsessive mindset and to personal growth , learning to accept yourself and not having co-comparison towards others . But rather comparing yourself with the yesterday you . The key to successful discipline is both consistency and a healthy balance at anything that does n't lead you to inner psychological problems . learn to balance not strict behavior that will eventually turn on you negatively .
