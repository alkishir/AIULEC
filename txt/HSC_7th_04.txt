Title: ................... Intensive studying is crucial now days. Some students learn their subjects alone in detailed way, so, they qualify their learning. The benefits of such strategy is to develop their learning in appropiate way. Thier goal is to understand the subjects and clarify some ambigious concepts. However, they need all the time to their own subjects so they can learn in smoth way. This point of view can enhance deep learning about the subject. The advantage of this to study in speafic and general way. In addition, in the first view they want to study anther extra subjects. It is valuable because they know general information about other subjects. It is effective because they will not get bored while learning. So, they are learning extensively about all the subjects The advantage of this view to learn the material in general way. I like the second view becaus you can enhance your own additional subject.
