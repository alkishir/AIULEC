Title: A strange experience Actully I choosed this tital because I have lot’s of stranges experience. First when I was child I leaved out of My country more than 8 years, when I come back to libya I was realy surprised about the life here, The life is not like How I used to live, and it makes me narviouse. Second, before I start collage I was wandering about the major that I have to choose but suddenly I found myself in English department, that was strange for me, but it’s useful in the seem time. I alwayes tells myself this experience and others makes myself more confudent, and I don’t have anything to worry about it.
