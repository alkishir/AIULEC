My favorite book I Missed Prayer by Dr Ayed Al-Qarni , is one of the books that has a deep spiritual nature , as it deals with the topic of the important of prayer in the life 
of muslim and its impact on the soul through it , the other present personal experiences about people who lost prayer and how this affected their lives . The book calls for a return to Allah and attention to prayer as a basic pillar in the life of the believer , and encourages a sense of reverence and communication with Allah at all time . I Missed Prayer is not just a book about prayer , but rather a call for reflection and positive change in the life of the individual and society .
