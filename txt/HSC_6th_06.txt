Title: Eating at restaurants with your family is a good way to build family ties I agree with that, because the family will have a different day, make a change in their routine, have a time togather maybe they can’t have in thier home, talk to each other. It’s a good idea to make the realation between them more beautiful and stronger, not just to eat in resaurant build family ties; any thing make a differ in the family lifestlye can build family ties
