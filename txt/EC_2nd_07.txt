Title: summer vacation last summer, my family and I went on a vacation to Shahat, we had a great time, in the morning, we visited the sight, and monuments of the city. we like the building there, so I took many photos of them. In the evening we had the dinner in a great restaurant, the food was delicious. We didn’t come back late. Really Shahat is a wanderful city.
