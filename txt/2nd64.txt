Nadia and I have visited a zoo many times . There are a lot of animals there , we have seen lions , They are fierce and huge . also we have seen many kangaroos . The guide welcomes because he knows us very well , He always gives information to us about the directions of zoo because the zoo is very huge so we did n't know the direction but maybe we will understand the directions in the future . Yesterday we went to the zoo , we saw Ahmed , he is writer the novels , we were a happy to he came , we have a great time .
