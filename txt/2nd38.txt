Memories are moment that we humans live through our life , some memories could be happy however some may be sad moments in life . For me my best memory was on my 10th birthday , so what made the best birthday was that new Cinderella movie of 2015 was released , and that made it a very special day for me . Someone 's best memories 
could be made with their families and friends and some may love being alone so their best memories could be the moments they spend with themselves which in fact is better in my point of view .
