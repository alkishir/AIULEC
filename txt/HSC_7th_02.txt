Title: Some university students want to learn about other subjects. Others belive it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification. Discuss this view and give your own opinion I simply words some students at university prefer to learn other subjects with the main subject that will improve their knowledge and skills in the same time with their main subjects which they want to study and know more about it. other student just prefer to concentrate their time and effort on what they want to study at university to come up with a result in this subject and its skills. In my opinion study more than one subject and its branches and types would improve the student knowledge and experience in the practical and personal life, and help the student to grow up and understand the other prefernences and thier abilities. In future that will help them to know the abilities of thier student and how they are thinking.
