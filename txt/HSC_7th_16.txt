Title: Some people feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Disagree, because at 21. First, the person is not complete the study. Second, sometime she/he isn’t work and does not have the enough experience for the parking lots. I agree which people can marry after 25 age that they are grown intellectually, this is favorable age.
