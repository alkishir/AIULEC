# AIULEC /ˈaɪ.juː.lɛk/: Alasmarya Islamic University Learner English Corpus 

**AIULEC** is a learner corpus of English writing produced by English major students at Alasmarya Islamic University (AIU). This corpus consists of written texts collected from students in all semesters across the English departments at AIU during the Spring semester of 2024.

## 📚 About the Corpus

Since no learner corpus of Libyan Arabic speakers' English was previously available at AIU or other institutions in Libya, this project was initiated to fill that gap. Resources like this are invaluable for researchers and educators alike, providing authentic data for language acquisition studies, corpus linguistics, error analysis, and curriculum development.

### Key Features:
- **272 documents** written by students from all academic levels (mostly females).
- Topics selected by English department teachers.
- Texts written **without the aid of phones or digital grammar/spell check tools**.
- Supervised writing sessions to ensure authenticity.
- Varying lengths based on student proficiency levels.
