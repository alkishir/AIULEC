Is the strict self-discipline the best road to happiness ? . In my opinion ( No ) , I do n't agree with this thing at all , some people think when they do it in the hard way they will get better life . Of course on , you have to care about yourself because if you care about you will get the better life that everyone want it , . I think when you put yourself in stressed and hard time , focusing on this and this and do this and do n't do this this that 's will make you give up in your life and never be successful in anything ; my advice to just live yourself in normal way , know the general rules and never think it about so much of course self-discipline is important thing but not strict way . it 
's how to make humans live good , normal and better life together and make you know what ; your and what you have to do in the life and with the people you live with them . make it easy on yourself and you will find yourself comfortable and doing good things . The best road to happiness is to care about yourself and know what 's yours and what you have to do to others .
