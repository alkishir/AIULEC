In my opinion the legal age at which people can marry is different to men and women . I see that the best age for men to marriage is between 25-30 because I think the men be more awareness in this age , and the best age for women to marriage can be between 20-30 because I think that the women be more strengthen to face life problems and more awareness to be mother .
