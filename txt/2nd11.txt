My best memory was when I in the school and met my best friend Fatima . I was the new student in the school . And I do not know anyone , everything was strange and I was very shy . In the first week , I stay alone and I probably did n't talk to anyone , then I met her and she was an angel to me , we was talking a lot about ourselves , families hobbies , dream , and every thing , from that time to up we were the best friends . we have been a friend for 9 years ago
